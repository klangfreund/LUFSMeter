/** A second order IIR (infinite inpulse response) filter.

 The filter will process the signal on every channel like this:
 
 out[k] = b0 * factorForB0[k] + b1 * z1[k] + b2 * z2[k]
 
 with
 factorForB0[k] = in[k] - a1 * z1[k] - a2 * z2[k]
 z1[k] = factorForB0[k-1]
 z2[k] = factorForB0[k-2]
 
 This structure is depicted in ITU-R BS.1770-2 Figure 3 as well as in
 111222_2nd_order_filter_structure.tif .
